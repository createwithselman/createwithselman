 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @createwithselman
As a frontend developer, I focus on building responsive, user-centered interfaces that blend functionality with visual appeal. My projects are crafted using solid foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while incorporating advanced techniques like SCSS, Flexbox, animations, and modern responsive design principles.
Iâ€™m also expanding my backend skills by integrating Flask applications with PostgreSQL databases, giving me a full-stack perspective that enhances the scalability and interactivity of my web solutions.
